# Hi,
    Myself Rahul Shahare, in this repository i'm going to store my coding logic. 
    I have a long relationship with coding. first programm of my life was a C program,
    Engineering Third Semister (2nd year). Subject was 'the C language'. I was in the class and 
    something was going on bord, first thing i saw was a PRINTF statement. but literally i didnt 
    understand anything in that classroom. wheni was unable to understand in the collage classroom, 
    i decided to join a special class for making the passing marks. but that special class turns into 
    turning point for me regarding COMPUTER CODING.

    Sir told me about how actully computer perform, how memory work, how we use the memery, what is 
    programming language and what about variables, cout and cin statement from c++. sir told me history 
    and background about coding, and how that actully works. and so many things. but at that point i 
    wasnt able to understand this much bcz that class was just for preparing myself for getting 
    passing marks only.

## Actul start of coding
